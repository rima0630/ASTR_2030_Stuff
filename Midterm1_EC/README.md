## ThreeBody_Main
This file contains MATLAB code that I put together using the initial conditions given to simulate a three-body system of objects orbiting one another on a 2-dimensional plane. 

## Questions
### a) What is one thing you learned from this tutorial?
I learned how to effectively incorporate the effects of gravity of not one, but two other bodies of significant mass on the motion of a third body. I then was able to learn and figure out how to do this for all three of the bodies using a built-in MATLAB function called ode45, which allowed me to propagate the motion of all three bodies based on the change in rate of their state vectors.

### b) The example at the end is a simulation of a solar system. Suppose instead you wanted to use the code to simulate a galaxy. Would it work as is? What about orbits near a black hole?

### c) Someone told you that the three-body problem is not solveable analytically. What about the n-body problem? Can we precisely predict where the orbits of the planets will be in 1000 years? Why or why not?
